taperescue - A tool for managing Oric tapes
===========================================

taperescue is a command line tool for processing tape recordings of the format
used by the classic Oric-1 and Oric Atmos microcomputers.

It is a multi-functinal tool, a bit like like UNIX tar, but also with live
audio I/O support so it can communicate directly with a cassette tape recorder
connected to the host computer's audio ports.

A key goal is to be able to recover the weakest tape recordings, that may
have deteriorated over the years, saving creative works from being lost
forever. Modern signal processing filters combined with statistical methods
such as Markov models and Viterbi decoding shall be used to get the most out
of the signal, in order to recover the Oric material with a minimum of errors.

Features

Command explanations
====================

taperescue must be invoked with one of the following commands:

Command       Arguments           Descrition
------------  ------------------  --------------------------------------------
-h/--help     -                   Show command line syntax

-V/--version  -                   Print program version

-l/--list     <in.tap/wav>        List contents of tape. For each file on tape
                                  the location, byte length, flags, errors
                                  and filename are printed. Flags are:
                                      B   BASIC program
                                      A   Autorun
                                      S   Slow format

-x/--extract  <in.tap/wav>        Extract individual files from tape

-d/--decode   <in.wav> <out.tap>  Decode waveform into a tape archive

-e/--encode   <in.tap> <out.wav>  Encode tape archive to a waveform

-p/--play     <in.tap/wav>        Play archive/waveform to audio output device

-r/--record   <out.wav>           Record waveform from audio input device


Format selection
================

Both encoder and decoder use the same flags:

Flag        Descrition
----------  ---------------------------------------------------
-f/--fast   Use fast format, like CLOAD/CSAVE without ,S option
-s/--slow   Use slow format, like CLOAD/CSAVE with ,S option

When no flag is set the encoder will use fast format, and the decoder
will autodetect the format of the recording.

Decoder engine selection
========================

There are three main decoding engines:

* Demodulating decoder - this is the default engine for slow format.
  It supports only slow format, like CLOAD with ,S option.
  It runs fast and can handle weak recordings where the 2400 Hz band
  is completely silent.
  The engine operates by detecting oscillations in the 1200 Hz and 2400 Hz
  bands, summing the bands using weights that minimize noise.

* Xenon decoder - this is the default engine for fast format.
  It supports only fast format, like CLOAD without ,S option.
  The engine relies on two cues to read bytes: correlation with a
  wide peak shape to find the location of '0' bit symbols, and an area
  measure over a pulse from trench to trench to distinguish '0' from '1'.
  The combination of these two cues gives resilience against both tape
  stretch and loss of high frequencies.

* Two-stage dual mode decoder - alternative decoder that can be use
  for both the fast and slow formats. This is slower and in general less
  accurate than the other decoders. The engine operates by first
  extracting physical bits, then decoding bytes from those bits.

By default, taperescue runs the demodulating and the Xenon decoder
in parallel, and autodetects the format. If slow or fast format is specified
on the commandline, only one decoder is used.

Options that control the engine selection are as follows.

Flag        Descrition
----------  ------------------------------------------------------------------
--clock     Expected bit rate in Hz (default 4800).
            The bit rate of actual recordings deviate from the nominal 4800 Hz
            frequency due to variation in tape motor speed. The decoder will
            attempt to adjust to such variations automatically, but will use
            the this parameter as the center for its search.

-2/--dual   Use two-stage dual format decoder.

--low-band  Restrict the demodulating decoder to use only the 1200 Hz band
            which is indicating '0' bits, disabling the 2400 Hz band.

--high-band Restrict the demodulating decoder to use only the 2400 Hz band
            which is indicating '1' bits, disabling the 1200 Hz band.

--area-cue  Force Xenon decoder to use pulse area to distinguish bits.
            In this mode the area for every potential physical bit is measured
            and the are measure tells a '0' bit from a '1' bit. By default,
            the Xenon decoder makes an automatic per-byte choice between
            area and wide cues, this option limits it to using the area cue
            only.

--wide-cue  Force Xenon decoder to use wide pulse location to distinguish bits.
            In this mode a '0' is recognized by detecting a wide pulse and '1'
            bits are inferred from the distance between the '0' bits. By
            default, the Xenon decoder makes an automatic per-byte choice
            between area and wide cues, this option limits it to using the wide
            cue only.

--grid      Use bit extractor named Grid (default is Pattern). This affects
            how the two-stage dual format decoder extracts physical bits.

--super     Use bit extractor named Super (default is Pattern). This affects
            how the two-stage dual format decoder extracts physical bits.

--plen      Use alternative fast format decoder named PLEN. This affects how
            the two-stage dual decodes bytes from physical bits.

--barrel    Use alternative fast format decoder named Barrel. This affects how
            the two-stage dual decodes bytes from physical bits.

Other flags
===========

Flag             Argument   Descrition
---------------  -------    --------------------------------------------------
-S/--start       mm:ss.cc   Specify start time in minutes:seconds notation
                            This causes decoding to start with a time offset
                            into the tape recording

-E/--end         mm:ss.cc   Specify end time in minutes:seconds notation
                            This causes decoding to end at a certain time
                            offset into the tape recording

-O/--output-dir  dirname    Specify directory to extract files into.
                            Directory will be created if it does not exist.
                            For use with the --extract command

-v/--verbose     -          Print diagnostic messages and tape contents in
                            hexadecimal format

-D/--dump        -          Write intermediate waveform(s) named
                            dump-<xxx>.wav when decoding.

Error detection
===============

The commands --list, --extract or --decode report errors when the program
finds that a byte on tape look incorrect.

Each byte in the Oric tape format has the following structure:
* One start bit, valued 0.
* Eight data bits.
* One parity, which should contain the XOR of the data bits, negated.
* At least two stop bits, nominally three, valued 1.

A sync error is reported when the start or stop bits are incorrect.
A parity error is reported when the parity bit doesn't match the value
calculated from the 8 data bits. Parity errors are only reported for
bytes that do not have sync errors.

The --list command reports the sum of errors in each files.

When the --verbose flag is added to a --list command, all tape contents are
listed in the form of a hex dump, where bytes with errors are suffixed by an
exclamation mark (!) for sync error, or a question mark (?) on parity error.

Limitations
===========

* Files specific to the Oric Atmos STORE/RECALL commands are not supported
* Only tape recordings captured at 44100 Hz have been tested
