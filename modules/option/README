option README
=============

option is a convenience C++ layer on top of getopt_long.

It allows command line options to be declared anywhere in a program,
but makes the options visible to the program's main function.
This can be convenient when temporary options are needed during development.

The following global functions are for use by a main function:
* Option::Parse to parse the commandline, and
* Option::Help to print the help text.

See header file Option.h for more details.
