soundio README
==============

soundio is a C++ module for audio I/O.

The module provides 4 main classes for an application to instantiate:
* SoundReader - for reading audio from a file
* SoundWriter - for writing audio to a file
* SoundRecorder - for capturing live audio
* SoundPlayer - for playing audio

In the interest of flexibility, testability and reuse it uses two common interfaces:
* SoundSource - a common interface for file read (SoundReader) and live line in (SoundRecorder)
* SoundSink - a common interface for file write (SoundWriter) and live line out (SoundPlayer)

The module can work against the following lower level libraries:
* portaudio
* libsndfile
* mpg123 - used when HAVE_MPG123 is defined
