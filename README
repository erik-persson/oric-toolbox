About oric-toolbox
==================

oric-toolbox is a set of command line tools for handling files for the
classic Oric-1 and Oric Atmos microcomputers.

The tools are:
* taperescue - a tool for processing Oric tape recordings
* basictool - a tool that can list BASIC programs in Oric format

More information on the individual tools can be found in
* tools/taperescue/README
* tools/basictool/README

Installation
============

To install the tools you need GNU make and a C++17 compiler.

You will also need autoconf, autogen and automake.
On macOS, you can run the following commands to install them:
    brew install autoconf autogen automake

After that, the command sequence
    ./configure
    make all
    make install
will compile the tools and install them in /usr/local/bin.

You can skip the 'make install' step, a 'bin' directory will also be
created in the current directory where you can find the binaries.

To find out about supported configuration options, type
    ./configure --help

To install in a different location e.g /home/john/bin do like this:
    make install PREFIX=/home/john
